üéØ ProstaRiskLab

A production-grade ML pipeline for predicting prostate cancer risk using clinical and lifestyle data. This project follows the MLOps checklist for scalable, maintainable machine learning workflows.

üß† Problem Statement 
Predict the likelihood of prostate cancer in patients based on clinical and demographic data using supervised classification algorithms. The goal is to support early detection and improve screening outcomes.

üîç Primary Objective
Build a supervised classification model to predict prostate cancer risk (Malignant vs Benign) using clinical, demographic, and lifestyle attributes.


üß™ Data Science Goals
- Early Detection: Flag high-risk patients to support preventative screening.
- Feature Insight: Identify top predictors like PSA levels, age, or biopsy outcomes.
- Model Explainability: Leverage SHAP or feature importance for transparent predictions.
- Performance: Achieve high recall to reduce false negatives (missed cancer cases).


‚úÖ Success Criteria
- F1-score ‚â• 0.85
- Response time ‚â§ 500ms in API
- Scalable architecture (microservice-ready)
- Secure token and audit-ready logs
